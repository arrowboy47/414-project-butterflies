	note = {This is a critical paper to my thesis, and in many ways, my master's is the sequel to this project. It investigated the {"}microclimate hypothesis{"} directly and challenges long held understanding of how monarchs select overwintering habitat. In particular, they did not find any compelling evidence that there are {"}special{"} pockets of suitable habitat within groves (e.g. where aggregations occur), and instead found temperature, humidity, and ligth conditions to be fairly consistent. They also found that each site measured was significiantly different than the others, suggesting that there is more flexibility in suitable conditions than previously thought. This study, however, did not address wind protection, thought to be a critical factor in the microclimate model, and offers many sections that lend justification to my project directly.}

	note = {Perhaps the first quantative study of overwintering sites in California. Most papers cite this article when describing overwintering habitat and monarchs. The authors did mark and recapture studies at three prominent sites in California, one of which is Ellwood Main, a grove I have worked on extensively. They found that there was high site fidelity with monarchs, which was previously unknown before this paper. There are many interesting anecodtal descriptions of behavior in the grove, but only a few quantitative studies. They do no mention microclimate parameters, except a speculation that monarchs will roost just above the cold night air.},

My same methodological criticisms stand as the first paper, but he studies more sites and does more monitoring this time. Of particular interest is his map of the Los Osos Grove at the end of Monarch Drive. He maps the distribution of butterflies over the course of the season, all in areas we do not typically see them anymore. His speculations about wind protection have been laid down as fact in this paper, however, and the dialog I have heard in my meetings on habitat restoration can find its roots in this paper.}

This paper, however, does not address wind in any measureable way, and instead only hints at the proxy via hemispherical photography. This data presented here was more related to direct and indirect light penetration throughout the year, and how overwintering sites compare to nonoverwintering sites. There are no statistical claims made, just explatory plots explained. Ultimately, this hemispherical technique has gone on to be used widely in monarch conservation since this paper, and is used today. I have collaborated with Stu, and can see the beginnings of many of his ideas in this paper.}
