	note = {This is a critical paper to my thesis, and in many ways, my master's is the sequel to this project. It investigated the {"}microclimate hypothesis{"} directly and challenges long held understanding of how monarchs select overwintering habitat. In particular, they did not find any compelling evidence that there are {"}special{"} pockets of suitable habitat within groves (e.g. where aggregations occur), and instead found temperature, humidity, and ligth conditions to be fairly consistent. They also found that each site measured was significiantly different than the others, suggesting that there is more flexibility in suitable conditions than previously thought. This study, however, did not address wind protection, thought to be a critical factor in the microclimate model, and offers many sections that lend justification to my project directly.}
